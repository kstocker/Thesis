#Introduction 

#Modeling and Inference for Infectious Diseases 

##Deterministic
 began my study of infectious disease modeling by working with a deterministic, continuous time model of an SIR disease. For the sake of simplicity, I began by looking at a closed population in which there was no effect of demographics or migration on the population. 

When modeling the spread of an infectious disease through a population, there are two key parameters of interest: the transmission rate $\beta$, and the recovery rate $\gamma$. The transmission rate is the product of the rate of contact between susceptibles and infecteds in a given population, and the duration of the infection is the average length of time an individual will remain in the infected class. The duration of the infection is then given by the reciprocal of the recovery rate, $frac{1}{\gamma}$. These parameters, together with the initial values of S, I, and R, are the necessary pieces of information required to simulate the spread of the infection through a population. 

The proportion of susceptibles, infecteds, and recovered individuals over time is represented by a series of differential equations given by the following:

\begin{equation}\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta SI \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I \end{equation}

In this model, $\beta SI$ is the transmission term, and represents the number of individuals flowing from the susceptible class into the infected class, and $\gamma I$ represents the flow of individuals from the infected class into the recovered class. 

\paragraph{Simulation}
To produce an example of what this model looks like in action, I simulated the spread of influenza through a boy's boarding school. I took the values of the parameters and the initial conditions from the book **INSERT CITATION**. In this example, $\beta$ is 1.66, and $\gamma$ is $\frac{1}{2.2}$. In a population of 763 boys, at the start of the epidemic 3 were infected and the rest were in the susceptible class. 

As the differential equations defining the model are not possible to solve explicitly, I used Euler's method to solve the system. In R, I ran the system of equations through Euler's method with a 0.01 time step for a period of 15 days. I outputted a data frame that included the value of S, I, and R for each time step through completion. Figure \ref{fig:SIRndSim} shows a plot of the proportion of each infection class over time.

\paragraph{Inference}
I then ran inference on the simulated data to retrieve back the value of $\beta$. To do this, I first created a function that simulated data for a series of $\beta$ values ranging from 0 to 3 with a step of 0.01, maintaining the same initial conditions and $\gamma$ value as the initial simulation. This function created a data frame of results for each value of $\beta$. I then ran a sum of squares function and took the squared difference between the results of my original simulation and the results of my estimation function. A plot of the estimated $\beta$ values against the resulting sum of squares output is presented in figure \ref{fig:SIRndEST}. It is visually evident that the minimum of the function occurs at 1.66, the actual value of $\beta$ that I used to simulate my data. Running the optim function in R to minimize the sum of squares function returned the expected $\beta$ of 1.66.

###Susceptible Reconstruction
In previous exercises, I had access to perfect and complete simulated data. While having such complete data is convenient, it is not realistic. Data gathered in real-world situations is much less inference-ready than the simulated data I have been using thus far.

Real data deviates from simulated data in a number of significant ways. For one thing, real data is incomplete. Not all cases of a disease are reported, so the number of infecteds at any given time point must be estimated using the number of reported cases multiplied by the reporting rate. There is typically no information about the true number of susceptible or recovered individuals, as collecting this information would be extremely impractical and cost-prohibitive. 

In order to run any kind of meaningful inference on epidemic data, it is necessary to have at minimum the infected and susceptible dynamics over time. Using the reported cases and the rate at which cases are reported, it is easy enough to construct the infected class dynamics. However, reconstructing the susceptible class dynamics is not so straight-forward. 

In order to reconstruct the susceptible class dynamics, let's first define the model. I will continue with the basic SIR model, but this time I am going to add in birth dynamics. The addition of birth dynamics into the susceptible class are crucial to the susceptible reconstruction process. To do this, I will define $B_{t-d}$ as the number of births at time $t-d$. Since infants are born with natural immunity from their mothers, there is a time delay (denoted by $d$) between when a baby is born and when it enters the susceptible class. The length of this delay is dependent on the disease. As before, I define the size of the infected class at a given time point $t$ to be $I_{t}, \in{\{1,...,T\}}$. Similarly, I define the size of the susceptible class at a given time point $t$ to be $S_{t} \in{\{1,...,T\}}$. Equations 12 and 13 give the model specifications. 

\begin{equation}
I_{t} = \beta S_{t-1} I_{t-1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
S_{t} = B_{t-d} + S_{t-1} - I_{t}
\end{equation}

In equation 14 I allow $I_{t}$ to be a product of the number of reported cases, $C_{t}$ and $\rho_{t}$, the reporting rate at time $t$. I define $\rho$ such that when $\rho_{t} =1$, the number of true cases has been fully reported. When $\rho_{t} > 1$, the number of true cases has been underreported. Additionally, I assume that $\rho_{t}$ follows a probability distribution with  $E(\rho_{t}) = \rho$.

\begin{equation}
I_{t} = \rho_{t}C_{t}
\end{equation}

Substituting equation 14 into equation 13, we get: 

\begin{equation}
S_{t} = B_{t-d} + S_{t-1} -  \rho_{t} C_{t}
\end{equation}

If we define $E(S_{t})=\bar{S}$, then we can define a new variable $Z_{t}$ such that $S_{t} = \bar{S} + Z_{t}$, with $E(Z_{t})=0$. In this way, $Z_{t}$ is the deviations from the mean of $S_{t}$. $Z_{t}$ therefore follows the same recursive relationship as $S_{t}$, and can be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
Z_{t} = B_{t-d} + Z_{t-1} -  \rho_{t} C_{t}
\end{equation}

If we allow $Z_{0}$ to be the initial value of Z, we can rewrite the previous equation to look like the following:

\begin{equation}
Z_{t} = Z_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{t} B_{i-d} - \sum_{i=1}^{t} \rho_{i}C_{i}
\end{equation}

To de-clutter this notation, allow $Y_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{t} B_{i-d}$ and $X_{t}= \sum_{i=1}^{t}C_{i}$. Additionally, we will assume a constant reporting rate. Now we can rewrite equation 17 as a simple linear regression equation:

\begin{equation}
Y_{t} = -Z_{0} + Z_{t} + \rho X_{t}
\end{equation}

Thus we have a linear regression equation relating cumulative births ($Y_{t}$) to cumulative reported cases ($X_{t}$). The susceptible dynamics $Z_{t}$ are the regression remainder to equation 18, and can thus be fully reconstructed.
